5007-bin,21,Failed to load latest commit information.
5007-bin,22,The general idea was simple -  the authors used double encryption with DES and Blowfish and the task was to decode the message.
5007-bin,23,Authors used some shady website for encryption and not the ciphers directly
5007-bin,24,"This website was adding random paddings and without knowing about it, there was no way to solve it"
5007-bin,25,Fortunately this was released as a hint.
5007-bin,26,The authors for no apparent reason have given an example payload apart from the flag
5007-bin,27,"This suggested a meet-in-the-middle attack using this payload, which was not a good approach, because the example payload was encrypted with different keys than the flag."
5007-bin,28,The calculations for this task were a bit time consuming due to key universum size
5007-bin,29,"Seriously, there is no need to make a task where bruteforce is taking minutes to run on 8 paralell cores"
5007-bin,30,"It doesn't make the task any ""harder"", only more annoying."
5007-bin,31,So what we have here is the encrypted flag:
5007-bin,32,"And we know that the flag was encrypted first with DES with padding, the data were transformed into base64 and this was encrypted again with Blowfish with padding and it was encoded as base64."
5007-bin,33,We also know that both keys are in the range 0-9999999.
5007-bin,34,So we run bruteforce first on the outer layer - to decode Blowfish and take all proper base64 results as potential hits.
5007-bin,35,And then we take those results and try to decode them with DES to look for the flag.
5007-bin,36,"There is slim chance that such long payload decoded with improper Blowfish key would give us base64 string, and in fact we got only a single hit there."
5007-bin,37,So we run the bruteforecer:
5007-bin,38,return False
5007-bin,39,return True
5007-bin,40,try:
5007-bin,41,pass
5007-bin,42,results[key] = decrypted
5007-bin,43,where brute() comes from our crypto-commons and is simply:
5007-bin,44,Run multiprocess workers
5007-bin,45,":param data_list: data to distribute between workers, one entry per worker"
5007-bin,46,From this we get the decoded data:
5007-bin,47,ZeroNights is a perfect place to discuss new attack methods and threats
5007-bin,48,"It shows ways to attack and defend to its guests, and suggests unorthodox approach to cybersecurity problems solving."
5007-bin,49,Generalna idea zadania była dość prosta - autorzy zaszyfrowali flagę najopiers DESem a potem Blowfishem a naszym zadaniem jest ją zdekodować.
5007-bin,50,"Autorzy użyli jakiejś dziwnej strony do szyfrowania, a nie bezpośrednio szyfrów"
5007-bin,51,Na szczęście później zotało to ujęte jako hint.
5007-bin,52,"Było to mocno mylące bo suguerowało atak meet-in-the-middle, który był tutaj błędem, ponieważ przykładowy payload używał innych kluczy niż flaga."
5007-bin,53,"Wiemy że flaga została najpierw zaszyfrowana DESem z paddingiem, następnie enkodowana base64 i zaszyfrowana Blowfishem z paddingiem i znów enkodowana base64."
5007-bin,54,Uruchamiamy więc brute-forcer najpierw na zewnętrznej warstwie - aby deszyfrować Blowfisha i wziąć wszystkie poprawne base64 jako potencjalne trafienia.
5007-bin,55,return False
5007-bin,56,return True
5007-bin,57,try:
5007-bin,58,pass
5007-bin,59,results[key] = decrypted
5007-bin,60,Run multiprocess workers
5007-bin,61,":param data_list: data to distribute between workers, one entry per worker"
5007-bin,62,ZeroNights is a perfect place to discuss new attack methods and threats
5007-bin,63,"It shows ways to attack and defend to its guests, and suggests unorthodox approach to cybersecurity problems solving."
