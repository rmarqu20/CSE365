7657-bin,25,The task consists of one 64-bit binary
7657-bin,26,Let's examine what's under the hood of this challenge.
7657-bin,27,"First of all, look at the 0x10000023 address"
7657-bin,28,Flag for this challenge is placed in this address on the CTF server
7657-bin,29,"So, obviously that we should just print it"
7657-bin,30,"Okay, let's examine the code."
7657-bin,31,There is not so much code and everything is pretty straight
7657-bin,32,In the first syscall at 0x100000b we input string into rsi register
7657-bin,33,After that we prepare registers for the second syscall
7657-bin,34,If we look at the table of syscalls for x86_64 architecture then we find out that this syscall is sys_rt_sigreturn.
7657-bin,35,"For me this doesn't tell much, so let's run the binary and see what this thing do"
7657-bin,36,I input 'A' * 12 and stopped before the second syscall
7657-bin,37,The state of our program looks like that:
7657-bin,38,Each register has rational and understandable value
7657-bin,39,Pay your attention to the values laying on the stack
7657-bin,40,"Now, let's execute this sys_rt_sigreturn:"
7657-bin,41,"You can think ""What the heck?"", but look at the stack before executing the syscall and you find out that all registers are set up with the values from the stack"
7657-bin,42,This named a stack frame
7657-bin,43,"According to the Linux man page, sys_rt_sigreturn function returns from signal handler and cleanup stack frame"
7657-bin,44,"So, if we input a pretty big string then we can control stack frame and hence overwrite all registers, sweet"
7657-bin,45,This technique called SROP -- Sigreturn Oriented Programming
7657-bin,46,You can read about it on Google :3
7657-bin,47,What's next? We can control all registers including rip
7657-bin,48,The idea is pretty simple: To change rip to syscall address (doesn't matter which of the two) and set all registers to write the flag into stdout
7657-bin,49,There are two ways to do this:
7657-bin,50,Using pwntools and its built-in class for Sigreturn frames
7657-bin,51,Then set needed registers with desirable values and input them.
7657-bin,52,And more complex way: finding the order of registers in a stack frame and create this frame by yourself.
7657-bin,53,"I chose the first way, but you can improve your skills by creating a stack frame by yourself (I did it too)."
7657-bin,54,Exploit that creates the stack frame and input it is placed below:
