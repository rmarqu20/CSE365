3947-bin,22,Someone hid his flag here..
3947-bin,23,guess we better give up.
3947-bin,24,Let's look at the server to see what it can do
3947-bin,25,"It accepts four commands, two of which seem interesting:"
3947-bin,26,decrypt: Decrypts the input data.
3947-bin,27,secret: Accepts an encrypted command and executes it
3947-bin,28,One of the accepted
3947-bin,29,"commands returns the flag, encrypted."
3947-bin,30,So it looks like we'll need to convince the server to give us the encrypted
3947-bin,31,"flag, then pass that to the decrypt command to get the plaintext"
3947-bin,32,But how do we
3947-bin,33,execute the secret 'flag' command when it needs to be sent in encrypted form?
3947-bin,34,Let's take a closer look at how the decryption is done
3947-bin,35,"The block cipher is used in CBC mode, with the IV provided as the first block of the message:"
3947-bin,36,Looking closely at the
3947-bin,37,we see that:
3947-bin,38,"This means that the ""plaintext"" block the server will interpret as a command is"
3947-bin,39,"controlled by two components - the decryption of the provided ciphertext block,"
3947-bin,40,The decrypted block is impossible for us to control without the
3947-bin,41,"key, but the IV is completely under our control! So, if we find the decryption"
3947-bin,42,"of some arbitrary block, we can select an IV that XORs into it to produce"
3947-bin,43,exactly the plaintext we're hoping for.
3947-bin,44,So what plaintext do we have to produce?
3947-bin,45,"We want the 'flag' function to be called, so we need the text 'flag' to be in"
3947-bin,46,"So, we're aiming to produce a plaintext block including the"
3947-bin,47,The steps to do this are:
3947-bin,48,Get the decryption of an all-zeros data block with an all-zeros IV.
3947-bin,49,"XOR the desired text ('flag') into the result, use that as the new IV."
3947-bin,50,Try decrypting this ciphertext with the new IV to check it comes out
3947-bin,51,containing 'flag'.
3947-bin,52,Send this ciphertext as an encrypted command in response to the 'secret'
3947-bin,53,Receive an encrypted flag as the output.
3947-bin,54,Use the 'decrypt' command to decrypt the flag.
